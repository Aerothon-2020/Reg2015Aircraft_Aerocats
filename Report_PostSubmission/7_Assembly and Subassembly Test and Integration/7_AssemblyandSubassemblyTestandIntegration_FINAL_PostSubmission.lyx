\begin_layout Standard
To aid in the design process, the plane is divided into four distinct subassembl
ies: wing, fuselage, tail, and main landing gear.

 displays all the subassemblies in an exploded view.
 The fuselage is further broken down into three parts; the forward, middle,
 and aft fuselage.
 The middle fuselage is the central section that all forces are transmitted
 to, since the largest compression loads will happen upon landing and also
 because it supports the payload.
 Both the forward and aft fuselage connect to the middle fuselage with gussets.
 The angled bottom of the middle fuselage is supported along the entire
 length by the aft fuselage.
 The tail assembly contains both the horizontal and vertical tail, along
 with elevator and rudders.
 The horizontal and vertical tails are joined by a slotted connection on
 the spars.
 The landing gear connects to the middle fuselage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The team decided on this subassembly configuration to improve the maintainabilit
y of the plane.
 If one section breaks it is possible to simply switch out the broken subassembl
y without having to remake the plane.
 For the flight ready configuration the only removable part (aside from
 the payload) is the wing assembly.
 The wing drops into a slot in the middle fuselage and then is secured with
 six Â¼ inch nylon bolts.
 The removable wing facilitates transporting the aircraft.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The propulsion system is housed in the forward fuselage with a removable
 hatch to allow for easy access to the motor and battery.
 The internally-housed propulsion system allows for the most aerodynamic
 configuration for the aircraft.

\begin_layout Standard
After 11 test flights on a prototype aircraft with a 25 to 31 lb payload,
 no structural damage was found on the aircraft.
 This validates the build quality of the team.
 The aircraft is able to be maintained and repaired quickly due to systems
 engineering considerations throughout the design process.
 This also helped the team to determine which sections of the plane were
 over-designed and could be reduced for weight savings.
