In order to build quality, reproducible parts, the team considered manufacturabi
lity in all aspects of the design process.
 The team developed a wide variety of manufacturing techniques.
 Labor was divided among several groups which increased productivity and
 allowed individuals to gain expertise at building specific components.
 The team has a dedicated workshop that housed necessary resources involved
 in fabrication and construction of our aircraft.
 Also, the team emphasized safety during construction and used personal
 protective equipment (PPE) at all times.

The aft fuselage and forward fuselage utilized our most innovative building
 technique.
 Top, bottom, and side view drawings of the fuselage were printed at full
 scale and secured to a foam sheet.
 The truss members were then cut to size and fitted together directly onto
 the print as can be seen in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Aft-Fuselage-Construction"

\end_inset

.
 This allows us to easily build easily replicable fuselage sides with exact
 dimension.
 After the sides were constructed they were secured to the top and bottom
 prints to add in upper and lower fuselage members.

The middle fuselage was very simple to fabricate thanks to generous help
 from Foxlite.
 Using drawings from SolidWorks, Foxlite laser cut the middle fuselage panels.
 The laser cutting allowed us to use finger joints

\change_unchanged
 to simplify assembly and create a stronger interface.
 The finger joints were mated and glued in our workshop.

The landing gear wheels were machined in UC's machine shop (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Wheel-Machining"

\end_inset

).
 The wheel was manufactured as two pieces.
 These pieces were pressed and adhered around the bearing.
 The steel axle was then run through the fuselage and the wheels were attached.
 Finally, the basswood and balsa wood reinforcing structure was built around
 the axle.

Construction quality in the wing is particularly important because of high
 lift loads it will experience.
 Spar caps were made by routing basswood boards to a 
\begin_inset Formula $1.75$
\end_inset

 inch width and splicing them together using scarf joints to achieve the
 105 inch wing span.
 The scarf joints were made by sanding identical tapered ends on each member
 and then adhering them together under high pressure using CA glue.
 The team then attached ribs and shear webs with CA glue starting at the
 root and working towards the tip as seen in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Wing-Construction"

\end_inset

.
 Constant inspection of the leading and trailing edge ensured no construction-in
duced wing dihedral or incidence angle.
 Next, the team soaked 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{32}$
\end_inset

 inch balsa wood and formed it around the leading edge of the airfoils to
 add rigidity.
 Finally, we assembled the rear spar and trailing edge to the wing ribs.
 A nearly identical process was used to construct the horizontal and vertical
 tails.

 Once all the subassemblies were constructed and mated together, the propulsion
 team installed the electrical system and the entire plane was wrapped in
 UltraCoteÂ®.
 After electrical system installation, the team performed an integrated
 system ground test to ensure functionality and proper operation.
 The Aerocats team followed the ground test with repetitive flight testing
 to verify aircraft total system performance.
 Dedicated roles and a systems engineering approach have allowed us to fabricate
 an aircraft that is lightweight, durable, and easily repairable.
